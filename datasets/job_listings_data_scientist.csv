As a Senior Data Scientist on our team, you will leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to protect our cloud infrastructure from security threats. You'll develop and deploy sophisticated anomaly detection models, predictive algorithms, and real-time analysis systems that identify and automate the mitigation of cyber threats across Amazon's infrastructure. Your expertise in statistical analysis, machine learning, and big data processing will be crucial in building scalable security solutions.

You'll collaborate with software engineers, security engineers, and fellow data scientists to:
• Analyze large-scale security data using statistical methods and data mining techniques
• Create automated systems for real-time pattern recognition and risk assessment
• Build data pipelines and ETL processes to handle massive security datasets
• Translate complex analytical findings into actionable security insights

We use the full power of AWS technologies, including Amazon SageMaker, EMR, and other ML/AI services to protect every AWS customer from security threats. Experience with Python and a strong background in statistical analysis and machine learning are essential.

We're looking for a new teammate who is enthusiastic, empathetic, curious, motivated, reliable, and able to work effectively with a diverse team of peers. We want someone who will help us amplify the positive & inclusive team culture we've been building.

On-Call Responsibility

This position involves on-call responsibilities, typically for one week every two months. We don’t like getting paged in the middle of the night or on the weekend, so we work to ensure that our systems are fault tolerant. When we do get paged, we work together to resolve the root cause so that we don’t get paged for the same issue twice.

Key job responsibilities
• Running experiments to assess potential risk of security responses.
• Expanding our existing LLM prompts to detect new customer signals.
• Analyzing post mortems to understand what data signals could have prevented the occurence

Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you'll be part of a team that's leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.
Team Description:
The Servicing Intelligence data science team leverages deep learning model architectures to help our internal customers use unstructured, multi-modal data sources - text, image, and audio data. We partner with product, tech, and business teams to deliver solutions spanning from using generative AI to conduct information extraction on millions of document images to analyzing call transcripts to identify customer pain points. You will be the driving force to experiment, innovate, and create next generation experiences powered by the latest emerging generative AI technologies.
Role Description:
In this role, you will:
• Harness the power of transformer model architectures to automatically identify emerging customer pain points in millions of call transcripts.
• Fine-tune large language models (LLMs) and large multi-modal models (LMMs) for extractive and abstractive tasks to search for complex evidence statements in unstructured, multi-page, documents images.
• Manage large scale data annotation projects by guiding frontline agents to curate high quality datasets, delivering model improvements by proposing, managing, and monitoring improvements to data collection processes.
• Work on a team of data scientists to build practical machine learning solutions through all phases of development, including designing, training, evaluating, and monitoring models.
• Communicate frequently with business stakeholders, including everything from brainstorming verbiage to include in a prompt engineering experiment to ascertaining which model evaluation metric best aligns data science outputs with business objectives.
• Collaborate with machine learning engineers to develop, deploy, troubleshoot, optimize, and maintain model pipelines with activities spanning from building reusable Kubeflow components for LLM fine-tuning to conversing about the cost impacts of model architecture choices.
• Leverage a broad stack of technologies including Pytorch, Hugging Face, LangChain, LLaMA-Factory, GitHub, AWS and more, to automate workflows using huge volumes of text audio, and vision data

The Ideal Candidate is:
• Creative. You thrive on bringing definition to big, undefined problems. You love asking questions and pushing hard to find answers. You're not afraid to share a new idea.

Principal Data Scientist – Consumer Credit Risk Management Models and Data

Data is at the center of everything we do. As a startup, we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.

As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in computing and machine learning technologies and operating across billions of customer records to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time and agony in their financial lives.

Team Description

Have you ever seen the headline in the news “Banks Pass Federal Reserve Stress Tests” and wondered how Capital One determines how much savings (or “capital”) it needs? Or maybe how we analyze the potential impact of the next recession? At the heart of these questions are sophisticated econometric loss models that help us understand the ways in which the economy impacts our loan portfolios and guide strategic decision making at the highest levels of Capital One.

In the Consumer Credit Risk Management Models and Data Team, we blend cutting-edge quantitative methods, with a deep understanding of our business, data, and regulatory environment to build and deploy predictive models for losses, account volumes and outstanding balances. These models drive key strategic decisions for loss allowances, stress testing, and capital allocation as well as informing our earnings calls and recession preparedness.

If this sounds interesting to you, join us! As a Data Scientist on the deployment & platform side of the team, you’ll be at the forefront helping us to usher in the next wave of disruption by using the latest technology to deploy, optimize and modernize model pipelines and execution platforms that enable machine learning models to provide powerful insights about our portfolio and growth opportunities through new data sources. You will partner with best-in-class data scientists, analysts, and engineers to innovate solutions that directly impact the company’s bottom line in a meaningful way.
