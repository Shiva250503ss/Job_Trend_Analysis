About The Team

The Supply Strategy team is a community of analysts with a variety of strategic and technical skillsets. We work together to continually improve CarMax’s ability to optimize the acquisition, movement, and reconditioning of each of the over 900,000 vehicles we sold to retail customers last year, as well as optimizing our auctions for the over 700,000 wholesale cars we sold to other dealers.

Our team tackles complex problems while striving to be a great representation of CarMax’s 4 core values:

Do the Right Thing: We prioritize maintaining the culture of integrity which has set CarMax apart in the used car industry, and promote a respectful and inclusive environment at work

Doing so ensures that we have the right cars at the right prices in the right location to meet our retail and wholesale customers’ needs.

• Design and analyze tests to evaluate effectiveness of changes to our products or operational changes
• Enhance analytical tools, such as models, reports, and dashboards, utilizing them to monitor performance and drive ongoing performance

About Lodge Cast Iron
We got our start over 125 years ago when Joseph Lodge founded the Blacklock Foundry in South Pittsburg, TN. His scrappy, hardworking spirit continues to lead us today. As a team, we believe cast iron is for everyone. We’re dedicated to manufacturing American-made cookware that we’re proud to use in our very own homes and excited to bring to kitchens, backyards, and campfires around the world. Day in and day out, we work together to stay safe, have fun, and be better than we were the day before.

What fires us up?
By now, you may have caught on to the fact that we’re serious about spreading the joys of cast iron. And while we’re always on the lookout for ways to innovate, we believe in the adage: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That’s why we stand by a simple recipe of just iron and oil (no forever chemicals, since forever!). It’s also why we’re passionate about keeping our campus in our hometown of South Pittsburg, Tennessee, providing great jobs to our community. As we bring our cookware to the next generation of cast iron chefs, we’re looking for people to help us stay true to our roots every step of the way. Does that sound like something you can get behind?
