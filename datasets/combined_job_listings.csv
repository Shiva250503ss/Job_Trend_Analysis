Lodge Cast Iron,,,"Master Data Analyst

About Lodge Cast Iron
We got our start over 125 years ago when Joseph Lodge founded the Blacklock Foundry in South Pittsburg, TN. His scrappy, hardworking spirit continues to lead us today. As a team, we believe cast iron is for everyone. We’re dedicated to manufacturing American-made cookware that we’re proud to use in our very own homes and excited to bring to kitchens, backyards, and campfires around the world. Day in and day out, we work together to stay safe, have fun, and be better than we were the day before.

What fires us up?
By now, you may have caught on to the fact that we’re serious about spreading the joys of cast iron. And while we’re always on the lookout for ways to innovate, we believe in the adage: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That’s why we stand by a simple recipe of just iron and oil (no forever chemicals, since forever!). It’s also why we’re passionate about keeping our campus in our hometown of South Pittsburg, Tennessee, providing great jobs to our community. As we bring our cookware to the next generation of cast iron chefs, we’re looking for people to help us stay true to our roots every step of the way. Does that sound like something you can get behind?
